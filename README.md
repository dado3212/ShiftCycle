# ShiftCycle

ShiftCycle is a Cydia tweak that makes it so when you tap shift with selected text it cycles it through a variety of toggleable options.

The current options are
 - MAKING THE TEXT UPPERCASE
 - making the text lowercase
 - Making The Text Titlecase
 - MakingTheTextHashtagCase

To install it, either install from the .deb, or add the repository http://cydia.alexbeals.com to Cydia and download ShiftCycle.
